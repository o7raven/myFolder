WORKING ON (TO SOLVE)

 - filenames DONE
 - converting to MSB big endian 
 - FIXING MEMORY LEAKS 



PROBLEMS/TODO
 - no directories x
 - no filename x
 - fixed size (small) x
 - not a loop x
 - not a service x
 - error handling missing x
 - watchdog for watching the directory x
 - notifications after directory changes x
 - database for saving connections
 - only one device possible on a single port, will have to remove the device from the db to refresh it (a feature?) 
 - maybe adding ssh key auth?
