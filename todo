WORKING ON (TO SOLVE)
 - making a protocol for easier and more optimized packets
 - filenames ;) (thought about sending the filename before the file content ex. filename&content
                but figured making a protocol would be more approprapriate
                because with headers you define your own filesize instead of a constant)
 - FIXING MEMORY LEAKS 


PROBLEMS/TODO
 - no directories x
 - no filename x
 - fixed size (small) x
 - not a loop x
 - not a service x
 - error handling missing x
 - watchdog for watching the directory x
 - notifications after directory changes x
 - database for saving connections
 - only one device possible on a single port, will have to remove the device from the db to refresh it (a feature?) 
 - maybe adding ssh key auth?
