31.8.24 where i left off
    restructured the whole project into headers but it doesnt' work gott aiffix fix it
    when sending the audio file only 136 bytes have been sent 
WORKING ON (TO SOLVE)
 - num1 priority - PROPER ERROR HANDLING - DONE
 - making a protocol for easier and more optimized packets - DONE
 - filenames DONE
 - converting to MSB big endian - DONE
 - FIXING MEMORY LEAKS - intentionally left out DONE
 - saving sent file / improve project structure - DONE
 - RECEIVING BIG FILES (imagews binaries etc) - DONE? NEED TO DO PROPER TESTING - 99% sure it works
 - cleaning compiler warnings - activity for life
 - client error if server not active before running - FIXED client now waits until connect -ne -1 and handles ctrlc signal

 - sending n receiving in a loop - not possible atm due to file sending being fixed and not dynamic

 - able to select a directory to work in - DONE probably few bugs and mistakes but overall works if correct input is supplied (working on improving it)
 - better project structure - splitting in header files for easier access when making service - working on right now
 MAKEFILE NEEDED
 PROPER LOGGING NEEDED
 problem in saveFile.c with calculating the strlen of agent directory too tired to fix

BUGS
 - client bugs when server disconnects early - something with the signal style (won't quit have to terminate)  - FIXED?

PROBLEMS/TODO IDEAS
 - no directories sync
 - not a service x
 - watchdog for watching the directory x
 - database for saving connections
 - only one device possible on a single port, will have to remove the device from the db to refresh it (a feature?) 
 - maybe adding ssh key auth?
