WORKING ON (TO SOLVE)
 - num1 priority - PROPER ERROR HANDLING - DONE
 - making a protocol for easier and more optimized packets - DONE
 - filenames DONE
 - converting to MSB big endian - DONE
 - FIXING MEMORY LEAKS - intentionally left out DONE
 - saving sent file / improve project structure - DONE
 - RECEIVING BIG FILES (imagews binaries etc) - DONE? NEED TO DO PROPER TESTING - 99% sure it works
 - cleaning compiler warnings - activity for life
 - client error if server not active before running - FIXED client now waits until connect -ne -1 and handles ctrlc signal

 - sending n receiving in a loop - not possible atm due to file sending being fixed and not dynamic

 - able to select a directory to work in - DONE probably few bugs and mistakes but overall works if correct input is supplied (working on improving it)

BUGS
 - client bugs when server disconnects early - something with the signal style (won't quit have to terminate) 

PROBLEMS/TODO IDEAS
 - no directories sync
 - not a service x
 - watchdog for watching the directory x
 - database for saving connections
 - only one device possible on a single port, will have to remove the device from the db to refresh it (a feature?) 
 - maybe adding ssh key auth?
